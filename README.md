QGIS plugin aims to simplify handling of [Mergin Maps](https://merginmaps.com/) projects.

[Mergin Maps](https://merginmaps.com/) is a service to store, synchronise and manage GIS data and QGIS projects. Currently, [Mergin Maps](https://merginmaps.com/) is used as the back-end of [Mergin Maps Input](https://inputapp.io/), an [open source](https://github.com/lutraconsulting/input) mobile application to collect data in field.

A typical workflow for setting up a project for field survey:
1. User sets up the project in QGIS desktop
2. The project gets uploaded to [Mergin Maps](https://app.merginmaps.com/)
3. Projects and data will be available on [Mergin Maps Input](https://inputapp.io/) mobile application
4. Collected data from [Mergin Maps Input](https://inputapp.io/) will be synchronised back to [Mergin Maps](https://app.merginmaps.com/)
5. Data will be available to view on QGIS desktop
